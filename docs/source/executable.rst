Using Executables
#################

Once you downloaded the executable for your OS you must unzip the download directory. Windows and ubuntu provide this
via right clicking and extracting all.

Afterwards you can open the directory and execute the RAPDOR(.exe) tool.

.. note::
    It might take some time until you see the GUI.

You can the run the server which will open a browser window to display the tool. If this does not happen
automatically you can  either click on the Open Browser button or copy the displayed link.

.. note::
    If your tool crashes you can contact the developers on windows. If you encounter bugs in the browser window you
    might find error messages in the user interface that runs the server. Please copy/paste them when explaining
    what went wrong
