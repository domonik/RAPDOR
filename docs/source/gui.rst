Graphical User Interface
########################

.. note::
    To run the graphical user interface make sure you prepared your data according to :ref:`Data Prepatation<data-prep-tutorial>`.

To run the GUI just use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    RDPMSpecIdentifier gui --input /path/to/IntensityTable.csv --design /path/to/DesignTabel.csv


Further flags (e.g. if your data is already log transformed) can be found in the :ref:`CLI Documentation<cli-doc>`

Once you executed that command make sure to not close the terminal.
You can then open the corresponding page in a browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome).
Per default the app will be run under the following address. However, this can be changed.

    `http://0.0.0.0:8080/ <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>`_
