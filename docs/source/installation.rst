Installation
############


Linux or Windows
****************

.. note::
    Best practice is to install RDPMSpecIdentifier into an encapsulated environment e.g. via Conda:

    .. code-block::

        conda create -n rdpmspec_env
        conda activate rdpmspec_env


Pip
---

You can install RDPMSpecIdentifier via:

.. code-block::

    pip install RDPMSpecIdentifier

Conda
-----

Building a conda package is in planning but not done yet


Executables
****************

We also distribute packaged executables that will run graphical user interfaces.
You donÂ´t need to install those since you can run them via double click.
